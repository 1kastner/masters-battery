    <p>
        Welcome to "The anatomy of a gamer", a web-based experiment that examines some of psychological aspects of LoL players, their teams and performance! I'm excited to invite all League of Legends-players to participate. Before taking part in this study, please read the consent form below.

    <p>
        This study involves a web-based experiment designed to understand how different aspects of information processing and team cohesion contribute to performance in League of Legends players and their teams. The study is being conducted by Tuuli Pöllänen at the University of Ljubljana, and is mentored by Professor dr. Grega Repovš.

    <p>
        The sequence of tests consists of demographic items and two questionnaires, followed up by four tasks for assessing cognitive functions. The experiment takes approximately thirty minutes and other than for information about summoner name, game region and team name (if you have one), participation is anonymous. All responses are treated as confidential, and you may withdraw from the study at any time. If you have further questions about this study or participants' rights, you can contact the investigator, Tuuli Pöllänen, by sending her e-mail at leagueoflegends.research@gmail.com.

        Finally, since this is a web experiment, the results can be impacted by things such as system load and by uncontrollable events in your environment, and there are a few precautions I'd like you to take:
        <ul>
            <li>Please minimize the number of programs running in the background.</li>
            <li>Keep the number of open tabs in your browser window to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Make sure you will not be bothered during the cognitive tasks.</li>
            <li>Try to find a relaxing and distraction-free environment.</li>
            <li>Please complete the experiment in a single sequence. You will not be able to return to your session later!</li>
            <li>Short breaks during the instruction screens are fine.</li>
            <li>If you are on a laptop, you can complete all of the tasks on a trackpad, but I recommend using a mouse for your own convenience.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
