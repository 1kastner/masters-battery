    <h1>The anatomy of a gamer - Cognitive profiles and team cohesion of ranked League of Legends players</h1>
    
    <p>
        Welcome to "The anatomy of a gamer", a web-based experiment that examines some of psychological aspects of LoL players, their teams and performance! I'm excited to invite all players who engage in ranked games to participate. Before taking part in this study, please read the consent form below.

    <h2>Consent Form</h2>
    
    <p>
        This study involves a web-based experiment designed to understand how different aspects of information processing and team cohesion contribute to performance in ranked League of Legends players and their teams. The study is being conducted by Tuuli Pöllänen at the University of Ljubljana, and is mentored by Professor dr. Grega Repovš. No deception is involved, and the study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life).
    </p>

    <p>
        Participation in the study typically takes 30 minutes and will require you to submit information about summoner name, game region, team name (if you have one) and division and tier, but other than for that information, your participation is entirely anonymous. You will begin by answering a series of demographic questions and questions about gameplay, after which you will be directed to complete several programmatic cognitive tasks during which you may experience some minimal tiredness or mental strain. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        All responses are treated as confidential, and participation in the research is entirely voluntary. You may withdraw from the study at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have further questions about this study or participants' rights, or if you wish to lodge a complaint or concern, you may contact the investigator, Tuuli Pöllänen, at the e-mail address tuuli.pollanen@gmail.com.
