        <p>I have one last favor to ask you. Namely, it is imperative for my research that
            I get as many participants as I can possibly reach, and since I'm researching team
            cognition, it is very important that I try and reach as many players in a single team 
            as possible. For this reason, I'd kindly ask you to forward this study to your teammates 
            and to encourage them to participate. Your data is already invaluable, but it would make
            my year if even just one of your teammates participated!
        </p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about the study or would like to receive some information about the results
            when I will have analysed the data, please leave a comment with your e-mail address below.
